constant:
    N - population size
    k - number of sequences (prob only)
    I - time of infection
linear:
    a - population at time of infection
    b - population rate of change
    k - number of sequences (prob only)
    I - time of infection

so k and I are universal, N and (a, b) talk about population on those times.
